The flow should be: Add person, connect to a team, then when you look at person you can see there teams. Teams are conencted to sprts. You can have many teams and many sports. You set a default position for the team but can be multiple. When yo ustart a shift you confirm their position if they have multiple. Mke sure the ux and flow is great.
